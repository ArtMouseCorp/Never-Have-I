    You can subscribe to get instant access to all existing and future content.
    
    <h>Subscription Pricing</h>
    
    Subscription options can be: 1-week with a 3-day trial and 1-month. All prices are subject to change without notification.
    We occasionally run promotion prices as incentives or limited time opportunities for qualifying purchases made during the promotional time period. Due to the time sensitive and promotional nature of these events, we are unable to offer price protection or retroactive discounts or refunds for previous purchases in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering.
    
    <h>Trial Subscription</h>
    
    Your free trial subscription will automatically renew to a paid subscription unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial period. Any unused portion of a free trial period (if offered) will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription during the free trial period.
    
    <h>Automatic renewal</h>
    
    A subscription automatically renews for the same price and duration period as the original subscription package unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.
    
    <h>Manage Your Subscription</h>
    
    Subscriptions can be managed by visiting your App Store account settings. To change a subscription, please visit support.apple.com/­en-us/­HT202039.
    
    <h>Cancel Your Subscription</h>
    
    You can cancel your subscription anytime by turning off auto-renewal through your App Store account settings. This must be done 24 hours before the end of a free trial or subscription period to avoid being charged. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free service. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.
